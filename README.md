# Attack of the Oids - game development

This project was a bachelors-assignment meant as an exploration of game development for Android phones and should be taken as such. We were a group of five contributors and intended this project to give us experience in collaboration and system-development. As we all started as inexperienced developers with differing experience in everything from programming to projectmanagement, we hit a few bumps in the road and the project ended up with imperfections, so please view our work with some leniency.

As this project has reached its completion, any further development of this is doubtfull, tho it might happen one day if we so choose.



# Prerequisites

This program is buildt as a project in the Unity game engine (version: 2018.3.2f1), we cannot guarantee that it works in earlier or later versions.

The editor used for code is Visual Studio.

As this game was meant for the Android environment, an Android phone is recommended, tho this is not strictly neccessary as the game can be run either in the Unity dev-environment or buildt for most platforms.
